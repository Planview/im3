                    <dd>Our innovation strategy is emerging and we are working to tie it to our strategic objectives for growth. The lack of connection between project execution and product/corporate strategy results in an unbalanced portfolio making it difficult to quickly respond to market changes. There is a growing innovation pipeline, we are getting to market faster, and we are achieving many of our performance metrics. Innovation efforts have visibility, but it&rsquo;s not yet embedded in our culture.</dd>

Our innovation strategy and metrics are not clearly defined and communicated, and as a result we occasionally miss market windows and margin targets.
